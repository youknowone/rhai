//! The on-the-wire form of a [`Program`].
//!
//! This is what the project is for. A device that loads bytes runs no parser
//! and builds no tree, so neither the nodes a retained Rhai `AST` costs nor the
//! parser's higher peak is ever spent. Everything else — the speed, the
//! verifier — is downstream of being able to write a program out and read it
//! back somewhere else.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! ```text
//! "RGRN"          magic
//! u16             format version
//! abi             INT width, FLOAT width, restriction bitmask
//! u128            debug id, naming the diagnostics compiled with this
//! varint + utf8   source name, empty for none
//! section         names
//! section         constants
//! section         operator tokens
//! section         op-assignments
//! section         chains
//! section         switch tables, prefixed with a hasher probe
//! varint          declared max stack
//! section         code, verbatim
//! section         position table, empty when stripped
//! ```
//!
//! Everything outside the code section is LEB128, signed values zigzagged,
//! because it is read once at load. The code section is not: it is the bytes
//! the VM executes, copied in and sliced back out untouched, with fixed-width
//! operands so dispatch does not decode. See [`crate::grain::bytecode::code`].
//!
//! ## What it refuses to write
//!
//! Residual fragments are real `Expr` trees — precisely the allocation this
//! removes — so a program holding any is rejected rather than partially
//! written. A script function the compiler could not lower is rejected for the
//! same reason: Rhai keeps its own copy of that one, as an AST. Both failures
//! name what blocked them, because "cannot serialize" without the construct is
//! not something a script author can act on.
