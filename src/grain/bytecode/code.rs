//! The executable form: instructions as bytes, run in place.
//!
//! [`Op`] is what the compiler emits and what a disassembly shows. It is not
//! what runs. A `Vec<Op>` costs sixteen bytes an instruction and has to be
//! built at load, which is most of what this project exists to avoid — so a
//! program's code is a byte slice, and a loaded program borrows it from the
//! artifact rather than decoding it into anything.
//!
//! ## Why fixed fields rather than varints
//!
//! Everything else in an artifact is LEB128, because everything else is read
//! once. Instructions are read on every execution, so their operands are
//! fixed-width little-endian at known offsets: decoding is a match on the tag
//! and a couple of loads, with no loop per field. That costs about one byte per
//! operand against the varint form and buys a dispatch loop that does not
//! decode.
//!
//! ## Jumps are byte offsets
//!
//! Instructions vary in length, so a jump names a byte offset rather than an
//! instruction index. [`assemble`] resolves the compiler's indices into offsets
//! once, and [`verify`](super::verify) proves every one of them lands on an
//! instruction boundary — without which a jump into the middle of an operand
//! would decode whatever the operand's bytes happen to look like.
