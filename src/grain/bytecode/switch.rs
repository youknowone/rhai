///
/// Matching a case is *hash* equality, not `==`. That distinction is Rhai's
/// and it is visible: `switch 1 { 1.0 => .. }` does not match, because an
/// integer and a float hash differently, while `1 == 1.0` is true.
///
/// ## Why the hashes travel, and what that costs
///
/// Rhai's parser keeps only the hash of each case — the value itself is not in
/// the AST (`ast/stmt.rs:336`), so there is nothing to re-hash later. The
/// hashes have to be written out as they are.
///
/// And by default they do not survive the trip: `get_hasher` falls back to
/// `ahash::AHasher::default()`, and Rhai's default features include
/// `ahash/runtime-rng`, so the seed is drawn per process. Rhai gets away with
/// baking hashes into its AST only because it parses and evaluates in one.
///
/// So an artifact containing a `switch` requires
/// [`rhai::config::hashing::set_hashing_seed`] to have been called with the
/// same seed on both sides. That is not something the format can enforce, but
/// it is something it can *check*: [`probe`] hashes a fixed value, the
/// artifact carries the result, and a loader that computes a different one
/// refuses rather than dispatching every case to the default.
