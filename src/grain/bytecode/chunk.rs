/// Metadata only. Every chunk in a program shares a single instruction buffer,
/// concatenated in order, and a chunk names its span of it. That keeps one
/// position table and one instruction address across the whole program, so a
/// device reporting where it failed reports one number.
///
/// `max_stack` exists so the VM can size its operand stack rather than growing
/// it. The compiler emits an upper bound it can compute without a depth walk —
/// one per instruction — and then replaces it with the high water the verifier
/// actually measured. On a device that difference is the whole reservation: a
/// chunk of 25 instructions rarely stacks more than three values.
