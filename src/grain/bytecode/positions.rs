/// Instructions carry no position of their own. Diagnostics are the one part of
/// an artifact that is never read unless something has already failed, so they
/// are the part worth being able to leave behind — and an instruction that is
/// pure payload is one that can be executed straight out of a borrowed byte
/// slice, which is the larger reason.
///
/// Moving them out is close to free on bytes: they were only ever stored on the
/// instructions that had one. What it buys is that they can now be removed.
/// `tests/format.rs` measures how much that removes.
///
/// In memory this is dense, because the lookup is not always cold. The
/// built-in operator path builds a `NativeCallContext` around a position on
/// the hot path and needs it only if something goes wrong, and an error
/// leaving a frame asks for one per level on the way out. Indexing an array is
/// what makes that cheap enough not to be worth avoiding. The compact delta form in [`pos`](crate::grain::pos)
/// is the wire form, expanded once at load.
///
/// [`Positions::Stripped`] is not a degraded mode to apologize for: it is what
/// a device runs. Errors come back carrying an instruction address instead of a
/// position, and the host that kept the table resolves it.
