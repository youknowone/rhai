//! Turning Rhai's `switch` range arms into something that can be looked up.
//!
//! Rhai scans its range arms in order and takes the first one that both
//! contains the subject *and* whose guard passes — so when two arms overlap,
//! which arm runs is not a property of the subject alone. A dispatch table has
//! one answer per subject, so the overlap has to go somewhere, and the only
//! place it can go without keeping the subject alive across the guards is
//! here.
//!
//! [`split`] cuts the arms into disjoint intervals. Each interval carries the
//! arms covering it, in source order, and the compiler emits those as a chain
//! of guards ending at the default — exactly what it already does for the arms
//! sharing a case value.
