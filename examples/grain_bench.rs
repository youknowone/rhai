//! Rough VM-versus-walker timings, on the same AST.
//!
//! Indicative, not criterion: repeated runs, reporting the fastest of each and
//! the spread around it so a single scheduling hiccup does not read as a
//! result. Run with `--release`; a debug build measures bounds checks more than
//! anything else.
//!
//! # Catching a regression
//!
//! `cargo run --release --example bench -- --check` exits non-zero if any case
//! has fallen below the floor recorded beside it.
//!
//! What is compared is the **ratio**, not the time. Absolute milliseconds say
//! as much about the machine as about the code, and there is no useful way to
//! commit one; the walker and the VM run back to back on the same machine in
//! the same process, so their ratio mostly divides the machine out. Mostly, not
//! entirely — cache size and core count still move it — so a floor sits about
//! 15% under the observed figure. That is wide enough not to cry wolf on a
//! slower runner and tight enough that losing a fast path shows up.
